## Introduction

Parkinson Disease Detection is a project developed to assist in the early detection of Parkinson's disease using machine learning. The project includes a machine learning model trained on relevant datasets and a web application built with Python Flask for easy accessibility.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The web application provides an intuitive interface for users to input relevant data and receive predictions.

- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on input features.

- **Data Visualization:** The application presents visualizations to help users understand the prediction results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahul4112002/parkinson-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd parkinson-disease-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Input the required data and submit the form to receive the Parkinson's disease prediction.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model is built using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and trained on a dataset containing relevant features for Parkinson's disease detection.

## Web Application

The web application is developed with Python Flask, providing a simple and interactive platform for users to input data and receive predictions.
